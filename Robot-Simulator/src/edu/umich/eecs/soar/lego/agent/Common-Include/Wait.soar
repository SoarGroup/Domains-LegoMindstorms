#	Wait operator
#
#	This operator works by proposing its self and
#	also testing in the proposal for the absence of
#	a selected operator called wait.  This means
#	that if the operator is selected, it will
#	immediately retract its self and will not cause
#	an operator no-change as WM changed to cause
#	the operator to retract.  This wait operator
#	will also only fire in state no-changes which
#	happen when there is nothing going on in the
#	agent because it is moving and waiting for a
#	change in the environment to continue.
