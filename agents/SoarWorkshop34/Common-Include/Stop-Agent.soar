###################################################

# Apply rule
#   for any operator with an ^action stop elaboration
# This puts on the output link a command
# to each motor to have it stop.  Even if
# we know there isn't a motor connected to
# that port, we tell it to stop as this
# is a generic rule and will work no matter
# how many motors we have plugged in to the
# motor ports.
