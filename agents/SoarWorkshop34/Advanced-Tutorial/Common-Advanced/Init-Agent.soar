# This map is useful for knowing how to turn in the environment
# Each of the 4 directions has the following structure:
# <dir> ^name << north south east west >>
#       ^forward <forward-dir>   # The direction you face if you go forward
#       ^backward <backward-dir> # The direction you face if you turn around
#       ^left <left-dir>   		 # The direction you face if you turn left
#       ^right <right-dir>   	 # The direction you face if you turn right
#       ^color-left << brown white >>  # Tells if you are heading in this direction what color means turn left
#       ^color-right << brown white >> # Tells if you are heading in this direction what color means turn right
